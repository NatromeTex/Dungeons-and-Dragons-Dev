# Dungeons-and-Dragons-Dev
This is my attempt to digitalise the famous board game dungeons and dragons so that a group of friends can play together without the need to buy the full set

Python Requirements:
 Configparser

The files are structured as follows:
The Main files are present in the working dictionary, consider the python files as the backend engine of the game.
Each game is kept in a folder in the Games directory.
To create a custom game, copy the files in the default game and edit the JSON files to your hearts content.
The game itself is nowhere near finished, do please help out by contributions and feedback.
