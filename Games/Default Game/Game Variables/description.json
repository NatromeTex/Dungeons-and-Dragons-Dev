        "10000"     :"A simple armour crafted by stitching cured leather. The curing process hardens the leather making it better against slashes.",
        "10001"     :"One of the first things learnt by blacksmiths is chainmail armour. Increased protection from slashes and projectiles.",
        "10002"     :"Armour set made from iron cast in sand moulds. Solid armour blocks slash and pierce attacks but hinder movement.",
        "10003"     :"Low carbon content in the iron makes it akin to wood. The grain structure protects against slash and blunt attacks but breaks against pierce",
        "10004"     :"Mixing metals in the right proportions creates alloys that have superior qualities to any base metal. The conductive alloy channels energy around the user rather than through them.",
        "10005"     :"Armour worn by the castle guards. The Emperor contracts the most proficient blacksmiths in the land to mass produce these sets.",
        "10006"     :"Armour commonly found in the land of elves. It is said that elves detest physical fighting and rely on magic and ranged weapons for their fighting.",
        "10007"     :"Hardened armour from the land of brutes. Barbarians take pride in their thick headed, drunken brawls, this armour was created by a gentle brute when his father died in a tavern brawl to stop smashed skulls.",
        "10008"     :"Robes made for the monks at mt.Hōshōji and mt.Genkaiji. The fabric is cured over holy incense and fresh spring water, allowing it to resist curses and repel demons.",
        "10009"     :"Crude armour set made by skinning animals and stitching the skin together. Not as good as leather armour but would you rather get stabbed with it or without it?",
        "10010"     :"Battle armour from the land of reeds. Worn by Samurai, the armour symbolises pride and the Samurai code of honor: Benovelence, Courage, Respect, Honesty, Honor, Loyalty. The armour contains a chink for the samurai to perform Seppuku.",
        "10011"     :"Forged from Primordial Void leftover from Creation. Capable of absorbing energy and physical attacks. Created by The Emperor himself to bestow upon his feared Shadow Force.",
        "10012"     :"Made by the Master Blacksmith for the Knight Force. Capable of withstanding heavy attacks and fexible enough for mounted travel. The armour is so reliable that a band of 5 knights once defeated a 1500-stong invasion army.",
        "10013"     :"Robes worn by the commonfolk around <place>. The thin robes don't allow for much and are worthless in a fight. Very colorful fabric and patterns are embroidered.",     
        "10014"     :"Plates hewn from Brimstone found in hell. Very heavy and immobile, causes wearer to heat up and burn over time. Can resist vey heavy attacks and ignore fire damage. Causes weak enemies to cower in terror.",
        "10015"     :"Hewn from  the scales of a dragon, the heavy armour deflects attacks and projectiles while being flexible and light. If made from scales from a live dragon, retains the characteristics of the dragon.",
        "10016"     :"Robes made by an aspiring wizard when he came across some monk robes. The process used removed the incense but allowed for the robes to channel magic.",
