        "10000"     :"A simple armour crafted by stitching cured leather. The curing process hardens the leather making it better against slashes.",
        "10001"     :"One of the first things learnt by blacksmiths is chainmail armour. Increased protection from slashes and projectiles.",
        "10002"     :"Armour set made from iron cast in sand moulds. Solid armour blocks slash and pierce attacks but hinder movement.",
        "10003"     :"Low carbon content in the iron makes it akin to wood. The grain structure protects against slash and blunt attacks but breaks against pierce",
        "10004"     :"Mixing metals in the right proportions creates alloys that have superior qualities to any base metal. The conductive alloy channels energy around the user rather than through them.",
        "10005"     :"Armour worn by the castle guards. The Emperor contracts the most proficient blacksmiths in the land to mass produce these sets.",
        "10006"     :"Armour commonly found in the land of elves. It is said that elves detest physical fighting and rely on magic and ranged weapons for their fighting. The armour was clearly crafted with the intention of making and keeping distance from the enemy.",
        "10007"     :"Hardened armour from the land of brutes. Barbarians take pride in their thick headed, drunken brawls, this armour was created by a gentle brute when his father died in a tavern brawl to stop smashed skulls.",
        "10008"     :"Robes made for the monks at Mt.Hōshōji and Mt.Genkaiji. The fabric is cured over holy incense and fresh spring water, allowing it to resist curses and repel demons.",
        "10009"     :"Crude armour set made by skinning animals and stitching the skin together. Not as good as leather armour but would you rather get stabbed with it or without it?",
        "10010"     :"Battle armour from the land of reeds. Worn by Samurai, the armour symbolises pride and the Samurai code of honor: Benovelence, Courage, Respect, Honesty, Honor, Loyalty. The armour contains a chink for the samurai to perform Seppuku.",
        "10011"     :"Forged from Primordial Void leftover from Creation. Capable of absorbing energy and physical attacks. Created by The Emperor himself to bestow upon his feared Shadow Force.",
        "10012"     :"Made by the Master Blacksmith for the Knight Force. Capable of withstanding heavy attacks and fexible enough for mounted travel. The armour is so reliable that a band of 5 knights once defeated a 1500-stong invasion army.",
        "10013"     :"Robes worn by the commonfolk around <place>. The thin robes don't allow for much and are worthless in a fight. Very colorful fabric and patterns are embroidered to show the village it was created in.",     
        "10014"     :"Plates hewn from Brimstone found in hell. Very heavy and immobile, causes wearer to heat up and burn over time. Can resist vey heavy attacks and ignore fire damage. Causes weak enemies to cower in terror.",
        "10015"     :"Hewn from  the scales of a dragon, the heavy armour deflects attacks and projectiles while being flexible and light. If made from scales from a live dragon, retains the characteristics of the dragon.",
        "10016"     :"Robes made by an aspiring wizard when he came across some monk robes. The process used removed the incense but allowed for the robes to channel magic allowwing it to be used as a catalyst for select spells.",
        "10017"     :"Plates made from the scales of a fallen Greatwyrm. It is said that the Greatwyrm was inhabiting the great pit for more than a thousand years before Malar hunted the creature in a battle that lasted 10 years.",
        "10018"     :"Fabric woven by the magic of Selùn, tranforming the moon rays into fibre that can be woven. Being of the moon it grants blessing of the Moon to the user. The magical fabric can render spells harmless and glows with radiant moonlight.",
        "10019"     :"Yogi Robes are granted by the High Priest of Mt.Genkaiji to the most accomplished monks. The thin fabric allows the yogis to be one with the environment before finally leaving everything. The robes are treated and blessed with The God of Pain's seal, causing increased damage from sources.",

        "11000"     :"A simple shield crafted by chopping and joining wood. Not the best bit of protection, but would you rather face a fireball? With a shield or bare handed.",
        "11001"     :"The dwarf blacksmith who was living at the border of a barbarian village saw the brutes returning from war with broken pieces of wood. He simply took some iron and reinforced the shield. The barbarians loved the shields so much the dwarf's statue is still standing at Bróðurland.",
        "11002"     :"Same idea as the wooden shield but with iron, some bright goblin stumbled upon an iron disk and stopped a direct hit from the club of a brute. Leading to the total discontinuation of wooden shields.",
        "11003"     :"Created when some hunters broke their shields and had to improvise with some animal hide.",
        "11004"     :"The dwarf who made the alloyed set had some alloy left over so he cast it in a shield mold. Deflects energy and blows.",
        "11005"     :"The master blacksmith once smelted 1000 Electrum pieces to create this beautiful shield which features the royal insignia in the center.",
        "11006"     :"The addition of a spring to the handle allows the shield to deflect thrust attacks and projectiles.",

        "20000"     :"The exact origins of the long bow is not known but the goblins and brutes swear it was the Elves.",
        "20001"     :"Created out of an Assassin's need for a discrete bow. The lower range allows for better stealth.",
        "20002"     :"A wizard learnt that curving the arms outward increases the speed of the projectile. The curving increases the size and weight of the bow.",
        "20003"     :"A bow whose string is made from the guts of sheep and cows. The sinew expands on its own and imparts extra force to the arrow.",
        "20004"     :"A complex bow that uses pulleys to reduce the bending of the arrow around the bow. Increases accuracy and reduces range.",
        "20005"     :"Basic slingshot made and used by children as a toy, makes for a low cost projectile launcher.",
        "20006"     :"Bow made for the use of Selùn. Converts arrows to moonrays that inflict holy damage. Selùn had once used this bow to imprison Lykanthros, God of were-animals.",
        "20007"     :"A Compound bow that uses pulley enhancements to increase accuracy and damage while reducing range further.",
        "20008"     :"A bow made from fortified alloy that was annealed over Blue Flame. Inflicts Blue Flame after a small delay.",

        "21000"     :"Bow created to be wielded by the largest barbarians, crafted from the wood of a single Ironwood tree and strung with steel wires. The bow requires the strength of a brute. ",
        "21001"     :"Crafted during a giant storm, using the lightning from the storm to heat the metal. Used by Commander General Seraphina to bring on a storm that lasted 3 months.",
        "21002"     :"A Greatbow created from burnt wood from Ironwood tree. The charring reduces weight but makes the bow fragile.",
        "21003"     :"Analogus to the Icarus that flew too close to the sun, the sunbow has a very finicky firing pattern but allows for great range.",
        "21004"     :"Crafted with absolute Elven precision reducing fire rate but greatly increaing damage and range. Old dwarves recall of an arrow from the bow once travelled through 5 mountains.",

        "22000"     :"A mechanical contraption capable of firing bolts in a trigger mechanism.",
        "22001"     :"A crossbow attached to a handle and carrying arm that increases weight and increases fire rate and accuracy.",
