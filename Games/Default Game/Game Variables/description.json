        "11001"     :"The dwarf blacksmith who was living at the border of a barbarian village saw the brutes returning from war with broken pieces of wood. He simply took some iron and reinforced the shield. The barbarians loved the shields so much the dwarf's statue is still standing at Bróðurland.",

        "21004"     :"Crafted with absolute Elven precision reducing fire rate but greatly increaing damage and range. Old dwarves recall of an arrow from the bow once travelled through 5 mountains.",

        "40010"     :"When an adventuring young wizard was accidentally teleported to hell, he threw his staff into a lava pool. Over time the lava hardened around the staff creating a thick shell of brimstone. Very heavy but makes it easier to cast fire incantations.",
        "40011"     :"A staff that has been touched by corruption turns black. Corruption is the highest form of heresy and evil, corrupting everything it touches. It is observed that inanimate objects are not affected by corruption, does this mean that staffs have souls?",
